# âœ… Mixed-State User Migration Script - READY

## ðŸŽ¯ Script Purpose
The migration script `scripts/migrate-mixed-state-users.mjs` safely migrates users from mixed old/new state to unified profiles with **ZERO DATA LOSS**.

## ðŸ”’ Safety Features

### 1. **Comprehensive Data Merging**
- âœ… Merges campaigns from both old and new systems
- âœ… Preserves all points and metrics (takes highest values)
- âœ… Combines all wallet addresses from both systems
- âœ… Merges contacts, social links, and shipping info
- âœ… Preserves earliest creation date, latest login date
- âœ… Maintains role hierarchy (admin > core > team > kol > user)

### 2. **Backup System**
- âœ… Creates full backup of all original data before migration
- âœ… Stores backups in timestamped result files
- âœ… Can restore from backup if needed

### 3. **Dry Run Mode**
- âœ… Preview migrations without making changes
- âœ… Shows exactly what will be migrated
- âœ… Displays merged data summary

### 4. **Selective Migration**
- âœ… Migrate ALL users at once
- âœ… Migrate specific users by handle
- âœ… Migrate by role (admin, core, kol, user)
- âœ… Interactive selection process

## ðŸ“Š Migration Process

1. **Identifies Mixed-State Users**
   - Reads from `mixed-state-users-report.json`
   - Focuses on users with old ID format (`user_*`)

2. **Data Collection**
   - Gathers data from new profile system (`profile:*`)
   - Gathers data from old user system (`user:*`)
   - Checks multiple possible key locations

3. **Data Merging**
   - Creates new UUID for old-format IDs
   - Merges all fields intelligently
   - Preserves all campaign participations
   - Maintains highest point values
   - Combines all wallet addresses

4. **Index Updates**
   - Removes old indexes (`idx:username:*`)
   - Creates new indexes (`idx:profile:handle:*`)
   - Updates role, status, and tier indexes
   - Cleans up all old references

5. **Cleanup**
   - Deletes old profile keys
   - Removes old user keys
   - Cleans old index entries

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### 1. First, run a DRY RUN to preview:
```bash
node scripts/migrate-mixed-state-users.mjs
# Choose option 1 (DRY RUN)
```

### 2. Review the output to ensure data looks correct

### 3. Run actual migration:
```bash
node scripts/migrate-mixed-state-users.mjs
# Choose option 2, 3, or 4 based on needs
# Confirm with 'yes' when prompted
```

## âœ… CONFIRMATION

### **Safe, Practical Migration Script Ready**

## ðŸ“‹ Migration Results

The script creates timestamped result files containing:
- List of successfully migrated users
- Any failed migrations with reasons
- Complete backups of original data
- New profile IDs assigned

## ðŸŽ¯ End Result
