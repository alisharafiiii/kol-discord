# Discord Profile Display Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
Discord accounts linked via the `/connect` command were not appearing in user profiles when viewed from the admin panel.

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing User Profile
- User `@madmatt3m` had a Discord engagement connection but no valid user profile
- The profile key `twitter_madmatt3m` existed but was empty (type: none)
- This prevented Discord information from being displayed

### 2. Discord Data Not Included in Admin API
- The `/api/admin/get-users` endpoint was not explicitly including `discordId` and `discordUsername` fields
- While socialAccounts.discord was included, the direct Discord fields were missing

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Missing Profile (madmatt3m)
```javascript
// Created proper JSON profile with Discord info
{
  id: 'twitter_madmatt3m',
  twitterHandle: '@madmatt3m',
  role: 'core',
  discordId: '1385684131454652568',
  discordUsername: 'madmatt3m',
  socialAccounts: {
    discord: {
      id: '1385684131454652568',
      username: 'madmatt3m',
      tag: 'madmatt3m',
      connected: true
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated Admin API
Added explicit Discord fields to the user data returned by `/api/admin/get-users/route.ts`:
```typescript
// Ensure Discord fields are included
discordId: (profile as any).discordId,
discordUsername: (profile as any).discordUsername
```

### 3. Verified Discord Link Flow
The `/api/auth/discord-link` endpoint correctly:
- Saves Discord info to both direct fields (`discordId`, `discordUsername`)
- Saves Discord info to `socialAccounts.discord` object
- Creates engagement connections for the Discord bot

## Current State
- All 3 Discord engagement connections have valid user profiles
- Discord information is properly stored in both:
  - Direct fields: `discordId`, `discordUsername`
  - Social accounts: `socialAccounts.discord`
- Admin panel will now display Discord connections properly

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. The Discord link flow creates complete user profiles with all Discord fields
2. The admin API explicitly includes Discord fields in responses
3. Both storage methods (direct fields and socialAccounts) are maintained for compatibility

## Testing
Run `node scripts/check-discord-connections.mjs` to verify:
- All engagement connections have corresponding user profiles
- All Discord-linked users have proper Discord data in their profiles
