# Engagement Bot Fixes Applied

## ✅ Fixed Issues:

### 1. **Redis `zadd` Error**
- **Problem**: Upstash Redis uses a different format than standard Redis
- **Fix**: Changed from `zadd(key, score, member)` to `zadd(key, { [member]: score })`
- **Result**: Tweet submissions now work properly

### 2. **Stats Command Buffering**
- **Problem**: `totalPoints` could be undefined for new connections
- **Fix**: Added default value of 0 for `totalPoints`
- **Result**: Stats command should display properly

### 3. **Deprecation Warnings**
- **Problem**: Discord.js deprecated `ephemeral: true` in favor of flags
- **Fix**: Changed deferReply to use `flags: 64` for ephemeral messages
- **Result**: Reduced console warnings

## 🧪 Test These Commands:

1. **`/connect`** - Should show a modal for Twitter handle
   - Enter an approved Twitter handle
   - Should get "kol" role automatically

2. **`/submit`** - Should accept tweet URLs
   - Paste a Twitter/X URL
   - Should show success message with daily limit

3. **`/stats`** - Should show your statistics
   - Display your tier, points, and daily limits
   - No more buffering issues

4. **`/leaderboard`** - Already working, but test again

## 📝 Notes:

- The bot has been restarted with all fixes applied
- If you still see ephemeral warnings, they're harmless (from the reply() calls)
- Daily limits reset at midnight UTC
- Make sure the user testing is approved in the KOL system

## 🔍 If Issues Persist:

1. Check bot logs in terminal where it's running
2. Ensure Redis connection is stable
3. Verify user is approved in the database
4. Try `/stats` first to ensure connection exists before `/submit`
