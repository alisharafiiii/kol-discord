# Engagement Bot Tweet Submit Fix Summary

## Issue Reported
The bot got stuck when trying to submit a tweet via the `/submit` command.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. **User ID Prefixing Error**
The `isUserApproved` function was incorrectly double-prefixing user IDs:
```javascript
// WRONG - was adding "user:" prefix to already prefixed IDs
const userData = await redis.json.get(`user:${userIds[0]}`)

// FIXED - use the ID directly
const userData = await redis.json.get(userIds[0])
```

This caused the function to look for `user:user_sharafi_eth` instead of `user_sharafi_eth`, making it unable to find user data and getting stuck.

### 2. **Same Issue in updateUserRole**
The `updateUserRole` function had the same prefixing error:
```javascript
// FIXED
await redis.json.set(userIds[0], '$.role', newRole)
```

### 3. **Environment Variable Loading**
The bot wasn't properly loading environment variables from the parent `.env.local` file.
- Fixed dotenv configuration to load from parent directory
- Fixed Discord token check to support both `DISCORD_ENGAGEMENT_BOT_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`

### 4. **Dynamic Import Issue**
The `nanoid` package was being dynamically imported inside a try block, which could cause hangs. Fixed by moving it to top-level imports.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed User ID Lookups**: Removed incorrect `user:` prefixing in `isUserApproved` and `updateUserRole` functions
2. **Added Detailed Logging**: Added `[SUBMIT]` prefixed logs throughout the submit flow to help debug future issues
3. **Fixed Environment Loading**: Properly configured dotenv to load from parent `.env.local`
4. **Fixed Token Check**: Now properly checks for either `DISCORD_ENGAGEMENT_BOT_TOKEN` or `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`
5. **Fixed Imports**: Moved `nanoid` to top-level imports to avoid dynamic import issues

## Current Status
✅ Bot is running successfully (`nabulines_engagement#3015`)
✅ Commands are registered
✅ Tweet submission should now work properly

## Notes
The bot shows warnings about:
- Missing "Manage Roles" permission (needed for auto-assigning KOL role)
- Bot role position being too low (needs to be above 'kol' role in Discord server hierarchy)

These are Discord server configuration issues and don't affect tweet submission functionality.
