# madmatt3m Profile Fix Summary

## Issue
"Failed to update profile, profile not found" error when editing madmatt3m in admin panel

## Root Cause
The username index for madmatt3m had two user IDs:
- `1cbe8af5-ddcf-49a3-ad8a-3d338d6a9d54` (invalid - no data)
- `twitter_madmatt3m` (valid - has actual user data)

When the admin panel tried to update, it was finding the invalid UUID first, which had no data, causing the error.

## Fix Applied
1. Removed the invalid UUID from the username index
2. Kept only the valid `twitter_madmatt3m` ID in the index

## Result
✅ Admin panel can now successfully update madmatt3m's profile
✅ No other functionality affected
✅ Profile data intact

## Technical Details
- Invalid ID removed from: `idx:username:madmatt3m`
- Valid user data at: `user:twitter_madmatt3m`
- User handle: @MADMATT3M
