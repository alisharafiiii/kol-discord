# Self-Engagement Prevention Fix

## Issue
Users were able to earn points by engaging with their own tweets (retweeting, replying to their own content), which shouldn't be allowed.

## Root Cause
The engagement batch processors (`engagement-batch-processor-v2.js` and `engagement-batch-processor.js`) were not checking if the person engaging with a tweet was the same as the tweet author before awarding points.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated `engagement-batch-processor-v2.js`
Added a check in the `awardPoints` function to skip self-engagement:
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Skip if user is engaging with their own tweet
if (engagement.username.toLowerCase() === tweet.authorHandle.toLowerCase()) {
  await log('DEBUG', `Skipping self-engagement: @${engagement.username} on their own tweet ${tweet.tweetId}`)
  continue
}
```

### 2. Updated `engagement-batch-processor.js`
Added checks in two places:
- When processing retweets:
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Skip if user is retweeting their own tweet
if (retweeter.username.toLowerCase() === tweet.authorHandle.toLowerCase()) {
  console.log(`      ⚠️  Skipping self-engagement: @${retweeter.username} retweeted their own tweet`)
  continue
}
```

- When processing replies:
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Skip if user is replying to their own tweet
if (replierUsername.toLowerCase() === tweet.authorHandle.toLowerCase()) {
  console.log(`      ⚠️  Skipping self-engagement: @${replierUsername} replied to their own tweet`)
  continue
}
```

## Result
- Users can no longer earn points for engaging with their own tweets
- The system will log when self-engagement is detected and skipped
- Users can still submit their own tweets for others to engage with (this is allowed)
- No existing self-engagement points were found in the system during cleanup

## Note
The fix was applied to both batch processors to ensure consistency across all engagement processing methods.
