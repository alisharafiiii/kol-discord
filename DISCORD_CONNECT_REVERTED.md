# Discord /connect - Reverted to Working State

## What I Broke
I changed the session data format from what was working to a different format, thinking it needed to match some API specification. This broke the existing working flow.

## What I Reverted

### Session Format (Reverted to Original)
```javascript
// REVERTED BACK TO (what was working):
await redis.set(sessionKey, JSON.stringify({
  discordId: interaction.user.id,
  discordUsername: interaction.user.username,
  discordTag: interaction.user.tag,
  timestamp: Date.now()
}), { ex: 600 })
```

### URL Path
Kept at: `/auth/discord-link?session=${sessionId}` (this was correct)

## Current Status
- Bot restarted with original working session format
- URL path is correct (`/auth/discord-link`)
- Should work exactly as it did before I messed with it

I apologize for breaking what was working. The system is now back to its original state.
