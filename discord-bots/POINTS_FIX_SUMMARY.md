# Engagement Points Fix Summary

## What Was Wrong?

1. **Points Configuration**: Points were set incorrectly across different tiers
   - Users expected: RT=35, Comment=20, Like=10
   - System had: Variable points per tier (e.g., MICRO: RT=20, Comment=30)

2. **Stuck Interactions**: Over 1,200 interaction locks preventing points
   - Once you engaged with a tweet, you couldn't get points again
   - System was preventing "duplicate" points even for new engagements

3. **Rate Limiting**: Some tweets failing to process due to Twitter API limits
   - Tweets showing 429 errors weren't being processed
   - High-engagement tweets (>100 interactions) missing some users

## What We Fixed

✅ **Standardized Points**: All tiers now use RT=35, Comment=20, Like=10
✅ **Cleared Interaction Locks**: Removed 1,256+ locks blocking points
✅ **Points Will Be Re-Awarded**: Users can now get points for all tweets

## What Users Should Do

1. **Wait for Next Batch**: Points are processed every 30 minutes
2. **Re-engage with Tweets**: You can now get points for tweets you previously engaged with
3. **Check Your Points**: Use `/points` command in Discord to see your updated total

## Remaining Limitations

- **Twitter API**: Can only fetch first 100 retweets/replies per tweet
- **No Likes Data**: Twitter API doesn't provide likes, so we auto-award 10 points with RT/Reply
- **Rate Limits**: Processing limited to 60 tweets per batch to avoid API limits

## Manual Batch Trigger

To process tweets immediately instead of waiting 30 minutes:
```bash
cd discord-bots
node trigger-manual-batch.js
```
