# Discord Engagement Points Restoration Summary

## Issue Timeline

1. **Points were added correctly** via admin panel at https://www.nabulines.com/admin/engagement
2. **Reset script was running** - A `reset-engagement-system.js` process was stuck running for 30+ minutes
3. **Points got reset to 0** - The stuck reset script cleared all user points
4. **Discord bot showed 0 points** in `/leaderboard` command

## Root Cause

Multiple stuck processes were running:
- `reset-engagement-system.js` (PID: 82651) - Running for 30+ minutes
- `check-engagement-connections.js` (PIDs: 83911, 85760) - Running for 39+ minutes

The reset script was stuck at the confirmation prompt but had already executed the reset operation, setting all user points to 0.

## Resolution

1. **Killed stuck processes**:
   ```bash
   kill 82651 83911 85760
   ```

2. **Restored points** based on transaction history:
   - @hopcofficial: 960 points
   - @sharafi_eth: 880 points  
   - @emahmad0: 500 points
   - @salar_bloch_: 500 points
   - @saoweb3: 340 points
   - @salimteymouri: 340 points
   - @yaldamasoudi: 340 points
   - @danialrh_7: 340 points

## Current Status

✅ Points are restored and showing correctly
✅ `/leaderboard` command should now display the correct values
✅ Admin panel points adjustment is working correctly

## Prevention Tips

1. **Never run `reset-engagement-system.js` unless you want to reset ALL points to 0**
2. **Always check for stuck processes** before troubleshooting:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep engagement | grep -v grep
   ```
3. **Kill stuck processes** that might interfere:
   ```bash
   kill <PID>
   ```
4. **Use the admin panel** for point adjustments - it works correctly and logs all changes

## How Points Work

- Points are stored in Redis at: `engagement:connection:{discordId}` under `totalPoints` field
- Admin panel creates transaction logs for audit trail
- Discord bot reads directly from Redis (no caching)
- Both systems use the same Redis instance

## Emergency Commands

If points disappear again:
1. Check for stuck reset processes
2. Review transaction history in admin panel
3. Points can be restored from transaction logs
