## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [collageMode, setCollageMode] = useState(false)
const [collageImages, setCollageImages] = useState<CollageImage[]>([])
const [selectedTemplate, setSelectedTemplate] = useState<CollageTemplate | null>(null)
const [collageLayout, setCollageLayout] = useState<CollagePlaceholder[]>([])
const [draggedImage, setDraggedImage] = useState<CollageImage | null>(null)
const [hoveredPlaceholder, setHoveredPlaceholder] = useState<string | null>(null)
```

### Drag and Drop Events
- `onDragStart`: Sets the dragged image
- `onDragOver`: Prevents default and shows hover state
- `onDrop`: Places image in placeholder
- `onDragEnd`: Cleans up drag state

### Grid Layout System
