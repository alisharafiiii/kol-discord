# Pre-Handover Summary - June 25, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the debugging session and fixes implemented for the KOL campaign management system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Duplicate Campaign Creation
**Problem**: Clicking "New Campaign" was creating two campaigns instead of one.

**Root Cause**: Both CampaignModal and campaigns page were making separate API calls to create campaigns.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `handleCreateCampaign` in `app/campaigns/page.tsx` to only refresh the campaign list
- Added unique submission IDs and loading state checks to prevent double submissions
- Added extensive logging throughout the creation flow

**Files Modified**:
- `app/campaigns/page.tsx`
- `components/CampaignModal.tsx` (referenced but not modified)

### 2. ‚úÖ Campaign Card Rendering Issues
**Problems**: 
- Buttons appearing outside containers
- Analytics button showing for draft campaigns
- Team member avatars not showing for campaigns with 4+ members

**Fixes Applied**:
- Changed button container from mixed grid/flex to consistent `flex flex-wrap`
- Added condition to hide Analytics button for drafts: `{campaign.status !== 'draft' && (...)}`
- Fixed team member visibility by removing the `<= 3` condition

**Files Modified**:
- `app/campaigns/page.tsx`

### 3. ‚úÖ KOL Link Saving Issue
**Problem**: Links added in KOLTable weren't being saved properly.

**Root Cause**: Timing issue with React state updates when clicking Save button.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified Save button to compute `linksToSave` array directly
- Changed from async state update to direct `onUpdate` call with computed values
- Links now properly save to Redis when added through UI

**Files Modified**:
- `components/KOLTable.tsx` (lines 1038-1073)

### 4. ‚úÖ Twitter Sync Service
**Status**: Working correctly - no code changes needed.

**Findings**:
- Service correctly handles both old (campaign.kols) and new (CampaignKOL) data formats
- Successfully fetches metrics from Twitter API
- Properly updates KOL metrics in Redis

**Test Results**:
- Tweet ID: 1937601518993051997
- Metrics fetched: 187,484 impressions, 1,225 likes, 108 retweets

### 5. ‚úÖ Email Notifications
**Problem**: SMTP configured but emails weren't sending.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Fixed SMTP password in .env.local
- Implemented actual email sending (was only simulated)
- Added comprehensive logging with stages
- Fixed nodemailer import issue

**Results**:
- Successfully processed 24 pending notifications
- Emails sent to: ali.sharafi85@gmail.com, info@nabulines.com, daniel.martin@ledger.fr

### 6. ‚úÖ User ted3166 Cannot Be Edited/Deleted
**Problem**: User ted3166 couldn't be edited or deleted.

**Root Cause**: 3 duplicate profiles with wrong KOL ID in campaign.

**Fix Applied**:
- Consolidated 3 profiles into 1
- Updated campaign KOL ID to match profile ID
- Cleaned up duplicate data

## Debug Tools Added

```bash
# Test KOL link updates
npm run test:kol-links

# Sync campaign tweets via API
npm run sync:campaign <campaign-id>

# Debug campaign tweet links
npm run debug:campaign-tweets <campaign-id>

# Test email notification flow
npm run test:email-flow

# Process pending email notifications
npm run process:notifications

# Check user roles
npm run check:user-role <handle>
npm run debug:user-role <handle>

# Grant admin role
npm run grant:admin <handle>

# Fix JWT session issues
npm run fix:jwt-session
```

## Current System State

### ‚úÖ Working Features:
1. Campaign creation (no duplicates)
2. KOL management and editing
3. Twitter sync for tweet metrics
4. Email notifications for KOL notes
5. User profile management
6. Authentication and role-based access

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues/Considerations:
1. **Auth Errors in Console**: JWEInvalid errors appear but don't affect functionality
2. **Webpack Cache Warnings**: Can be ignored, related to Next.js dev server
3. **Rate Limiting**: Twitter API has 15 requests per 15 minutes limit

### üîß Environment Variables Required:
```env
# Twitter API
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=<your-bearer-token>

# Email (SMTP)
SMTP_HOST=mail.nabulines.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_USER=info@nabulines.com
SMTP_PASS=725264
SMTP_FROM="Nabulines <info@nabulines.com>"

# Redis (Upstash)
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=<your-redis-url>
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=<your-redis-token>
```

## Git Commit Summary
- Commit Hash: 0224647
- Branch: main
- Pushed to: https://github.com/alisharafiiii/kol.git
- Message: "Pre-handover: Fix campaign creation, Twitter sync, and KOL link saving issues"

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Campaign Creation**:
   - Create a new campaign
   - Verify only one campaign is created
   - Check console for submission IDs

2. **Test KOL Link Saving**:
   - Add a KOL to a campaign
   - Click links field and add a Twitter/X URL
   - Click Save and verify it persists

3. **Test Twitter Sync**:
   - Add tweet links to KOLs
   - Click Sync button
   - Verify metrics are updated

4. **Test Email Notifications**:
   - Add a note to a KOL in a campaign
   - Run `npm run process:notifications`
   - Verify email is received

## Additional Notes

- The system uses both old and new data formats for backward compatibility
- Campaign KOLs are stored in the campaign object (old format) for now
- Twitter sync handles both formats automatically
- Email notifications require manual processing or a cron job
