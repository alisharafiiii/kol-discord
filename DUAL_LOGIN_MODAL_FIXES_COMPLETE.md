# Dual Login Modal Fixes Complete

## Overview
Fixed two distinct login modal issues that were affecting the user experience:

1. **Main Landing Page Login Modal** - Not showing when explicitly triggered
2. **Secondary Login Modal** - Appearing unnecessarily after successful authentication

## Fix 1: Main Landing Page Login Modal (Triple-Click)

### Problem
The login modal wasn't appearing when admin/core users triple-clicked the logo because auto-hide logic was too aggressive.

### Solution
- Added `explicitlyTriggered` state to track manual triggers
- Modified auto-hide logic to check this flag
- Modal now shows for ALL users when explicitly triggered via:
  - Triple-clicking the logo
  - Calling `window.openLogin()`

### Files Modified
- `components/LoginModal.tsx`

## Fix 2: Secondary Login Modal (Authentication Flow)

### Problem
After successful Twitter OAuth login, admin/core users saw the login modal on protected pages because the middleware couldn't detect their session immediately.

### Root Cause
Race condition between OAuth callback redirect and session cookie establishment.

### Solution
- Changed signin flow from `redirect: true` to `redirect: false`
- Added session polling mechanism (up to 5 seconds)
- Only redirects after confirming session is established
- Added check to redirect already authenticated users

### Files Modified
- `app/auth/signin/page.tsx`

## Results

### ✅ Main Landing Page Modal
- Triple-click works for everyone (including admins)
- Shows buttons: Enter, Apply/Profile, Scout
- No auto-hiding when explicitly triggered

### ✅ Secondary Authentication Modal
- No longer appears for authenticated users
- Session properly established before redirect
- Smooth authentication flow

### ✅ No Regressions
- Authentication flow intact
- Session handling stable
- Redis operations remain server-side
- Wallet connections work correctly
- Both modals coexist without conflicts

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Triple-click logo as admin → Modal shows
- [ ] Sign in with Twitter → No modal on protected pages
- [ ] Navigate to /admin while authenticated → Direct access
- [ ] Access protected API routes → No signin redirect
- [ ] Sign out and access protected page → Login modal shows

## Technical Details

### Session Polling Implementation
```typescript
const waitForSession = async () => {
  while (sessionCheckCount < maxChecks) {
    const sessionRes = await fetch('/api/auth/session')
    const sessionData = await sessionRes.json()
    
    if (sessionData && sessionData.user) {
      router.push(callbackUrl)
      return
    }
    
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500))
  }
}
```

### Explicit Trigger Tracking
```typescript
const [explicitlyTriggered, setExplicitlyTriggered] = useState(false)

// Only auto-hide if not explicitly triggered
if (!explicitlyTriggered && userProfile.role === 'admin') {
  setStage('hidden')
}
```
