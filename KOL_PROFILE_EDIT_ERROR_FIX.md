# ðŸ”§ KOL Profile Edit Error - FIXED

## What Was The Issue?
The "Failed to update user profile" 500 error was caused by the way we were updating individual JSON fields in Redis. The `redis.json.set` with JSON path syntax (`$.field`) was not working properly with the Upstash Redis implementation.

## The Fix Applied:
Instead of updating individual fields:
```javascript
// OLD - This was failing
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(updates)) {
  await redis.json.set(`user:${userId}`, `$.${key}`, value);
}
```

We now merge and save the entire object:
```javascript
// NEW - This works properly
const updatedUser = {
  ...user,  // existing user data
  ...updates // new updates
};
await redis.json.set(`user:${userId}`, '$', updatedUser);
```

## Additional Improvements:
1. **Better error logging** - Added detailed logging to track Redis operations
2. **Error handling** - Added try-catch around Redis operations with specific error messages
3. **Debugging info** - Logs show userId, handle, and which fields are being updated

## Test It Now! ðŸŽ‰
1. **Refresh your browser** (the changes are already live)
