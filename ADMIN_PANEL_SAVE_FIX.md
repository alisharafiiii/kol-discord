# Admin Panel Save Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Approval Status Not Persisting
**Problem**: When clicking Approve/Pending/Reject buttons, the status would change in the UI but not persist after refresh.

### 2. Role/Tier Changes Not Saving
**Problem**: When changing role or tier via dropdowns, changes wouldn't persist.

## Root Cause
The ProfileModal component had a state management issue:
- The `editedUser` state wasn't being updated when status/role/tier buttons were clicked
- The `handleSave` function only saved fields that were explicitly edited in text inputs
- The status/role/tier changes were calling their respective update functions directly but not updating the local `editedUser` state

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated Status Buttons
Now when clicking Approve/Pending/Reject:
- Calls the `onStatusChange` function (immediate update)
- Also updates `editedUser` state (for save button)

### 2. Updated Role/Tier Dropdowns
- Changed to use `editedUser.role` and `editedUser.tier` instead of `user.role` and `user.tier`
- Updates both call the change function AND update `editedUser` state

### 3. Enhanced Save Function
Added checks to include:
- `approvalStatus` changes
- `role` changes  
- `tier` changes

## Result
✅ All changes now persist properly
✅ Status, role, and tier updates are included when "Save Changes" is clicked
✅ No data loss on refresh
✅ Both immediate updates (via buttons) and batch updates (via save) work correctly

## Technical Details
- Fixed in: `components/AdminPanel.tsx`
- Component: `ProfileModal`
- No backend changes needed - the issue was purely frontend state management
