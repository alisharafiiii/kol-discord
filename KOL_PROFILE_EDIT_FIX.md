# âœ… KOL Profile Edit Fix - RESOLVED

## What Was The Issue?
The "Insufficient permissions" error occurred because the authentication check wasn't properly reading the user's role from the session.

## What We Fixed:
1. **Added proper authentication imports** - Now using `authOptions` with `getServerSession`
2. **Enhanced role checking** - The API now:
   - Checks for master admins (sharafi_eth, alinabu) 
   - Looks for role in multiple places in the session object
   - Falls back to database lookup if role isn't in session
   - Allows admin, core, and team roles to edit

## How The System Works Now:

### Who Can View Profiles:
- **Everyone** - All logged-in users can view KOL profiles

### Who Can Edit Profiles:
- **Admin role** - Full edit access
- **Core role** - Full edit access  
- **Team role** - Full edit access
- **KOL/Scout/User roles** - View only, no edit button shown

### Who Can Add Notes:
- **Admin role** - Can add internal notes
- **Core role** - Can add internal notes
- **Others** - Cannot add notes

## Testing The Fix:

1. **Make sure you're logged in** with an admin/core/team account
2. **Go to any campaign page**
3. **Click on a KOL's name** to open their profile
4. **Click "Edit Profile"** button (should now work!)
5. **Edit contact info** and click "Save Changes"

## Debugging Tips:

If you still see "Insufficient permissions":
1. Check browser console for session data
2. Try logging out and back in
3. Check server logs for role information

The fix is now live in your development environment. The edit functionality should work properly for users with the correct roles! ðŸŽ‰
