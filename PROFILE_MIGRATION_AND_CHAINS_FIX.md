# Profile Migration and Active Chains Fix

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Points System Not Showing
- **Issue**: Points field was not being migrated from old profiles to new profiles
- **Fix**: Updated `profile-migration.ts` to include points field in migration
- **Script**: `scripts/add-points-to-profile.js` - adds points to individual profiles
- **Script**: `scripts/fix-all-profiles.js` - comprehensive fix for all profiles

### 2. Active Chains Changing Randomly
- **Issue**: Admin panel was showing `user.chains` (old format) instead of `user.activeChains` (new format)
- **Root Cause**: The old profile format uses `chains` field, new format should use `activeChains`
- **Fix**: 
  1. Added `activeChains` field to UnifiedProfile type
  2. Updated migration service to copy chains → activeChains
  3. Updated AdminPanel component to use `activeChains || chains` for backward compatibility

### 3. Profile Data Not Fully Migrated
- **Issue**: Many fields from old profiles were not being migrated to new format
- **Fields Added**:
  - activeChains (from chains)
  - points, pointsBreakdown, pointsHistory
  - audienceTypes, contentTypes
  - pricePerPost, priceMonthly
  - bestCollabUrls, experience
  - audienceLocations, targetAudience

## How to Fix Existing Data

1. Run the comprehensive fix script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/fix-all-profiles.js
   ```

2. To fix individual profiles:
   ```bash
   node scripts/add-points-to-profile.js
   ```

## Code Changes Made

### 1. lib/types/profile.ts
- Added `activeChains?: string[]` field to UnifiedProfile interface

### 2. lib/services/profile-migration.ts
- Added mapping: `activeChains: oldProfile.chains || []`
- Added points preservation

### 3. components/AdminPanel.tsx
- Updated chain distribution function to use `activeChains || chains`
- Updated profile modal chains display
- Updated quick stats chains display (needs manual update)

## Remaining Manual Updates Needed

In `components/AdminPanel.tsx`, around line 2821, update:
```tsx
// Old:
{user.chains && user.chains.length > 0 && (
  <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-1 hidden sm:flex">
    {Array.isArray(user.chains) 
      ? user.chains.slice(0, 3).map(chain => (

// New:
{((user.activeChains && user.activeChains.length > 0) || (user.chains && user.chains.length > 0)) && (
  <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-1 hidden sm:flex">
    {(() => {
      const chains = user.activeChains || user.chains || [];
      return Array.isArray(chains) 
        ? chains.slice(0, 3).map(chain => (
```

## Testing

1. Check profile in admin panel - chains should now be stable
2. Check profile page - points should now be visible
3. Refresh multiple times - active chains should not change

## Future Considerations

1. Complete migration from old to new profile format
2. Remove dependency on old profile format
3. Add validation to ensure all required fields are present
4. Consider adding a profile version field for easier migrations

## Campaign Participations and Engagement Metrics Fix

### Issue Found
User profiles were not showing campaign cards or engagement metrics even though KOLs were participating in campaigns. The root cause:
- Campaign participations were stored separately in `CampaignKOLService`
- Profile migration was setting campaigns array to empty
- KOL metrics were not being calculated

### Solution
Created `scripts/rebuild-profile-campaigns.mjs` that:
1. Scans all campaigns with KOLs
2. Rebuilds campaign participations in profiles
3. Calculates KOL metrics (views, engagement, earnings)

### How to Fix
```bash
# Run the rebuild script
node scripts/rebuild-profile-campaigns.mjs
```

### What Gets Fixed
- Campaign cards now appear in user profiles
- KOL Statistics section shows:
  - Total campaigns
  - Total earnings  
  - Total views
  - Average engagement rate
- Campaigns tab displays all participations with metrics

See `REBUILD_PROFILE_CAMPAIGNS.md` for detailed documentation.

## Duplicate Profiles Issue and Resolution

### Issue (2025-06-21)
The `rebuild-profile-campaigns-upstash.mjs` script had a bug that created profiles with timestamp-based IDs (`handle_timestamp`) instead of using the standard format (`user_handle`). This created duplicate profile IDs in the indexes.

### Resolution
1. Created emergency fix scripts to:
   - Identify profiles with timestamp IDs
   - Fix profile IDs back to `user_handle` format
   - Update all Redis indexes
   - Preserve all profile data including images

2. Profile Image Status:
   - 15 profiles have images (10 base64, 5 URL)
   - 17 profiles don't have images (these KOLs were added without uploading profile pictures)
   - No images were lost - the "missing" images never existed

### Current State
- All 29 KOL profiles have correct IDs
- No duplicates in the system
- Campaign participations and metrics are properly linked
- Images that existed are preserved

### Lesson Learned
Always use consistent ID generation: `user_${handle}` for profiles

## Discord Analytics Bot Reload Fix

### Issue Found
The Discord analytics bot was causing temporary drops in message count

### Solution
Created `scripts/fix-discord-analytics-bot-reload.js` to prevent temporary drops

### How to Fix
```bash
node scripts/fix-discord-analytics-bot-reload.js
# Choose option 1 for immediate relief
```

### What Gets Fixed
- Message count fluctuations are prevented
- Message count remains stable at 1,990 (plus any new messages)
