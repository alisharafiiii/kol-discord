# Session Timing Fix for Secondary Login Modal

## Problem
After successful Twitter OAuth login, admin/core users (like sharafi_eth) were seeing the secondary login modal appear on protected pages because the middleware couldn't detect their authenticated session.

## Root Cause
Race condition between:
1. OAuth callback completing and redirecting
2. Session cookie being set and propagated
3. Middleware checking for JWT token

The middleware was checking for authentication before the session cookie was fully established, resulting in:
```
[Middleware] Protected path: /admin
[Middleware] Token exists: false
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Changed Sign-in Flow (`app/auth/signin/page.tsx`)
- Changed from `redirect: true` to `redirect: false` in signIn call
- Added session polling mechanism to wait for session establishment
- Polls `/api/auth/session` endpoint up to 10 times (5 seconds total)
- Only redirects after confirming session is established

### 2. Added Session Check for Already Authenticated Users
- If user navigates to signin page while already authenticated, immediately redirect
- Prevents unnecessary re-authentication attempts

### 3. Session Verification Process
```typescript
// Wait for session to be established (poll for up to 5 seconds)
const waitForSession = async () => {
  while (sessionCheckCount < maxChecks) {
    const sessionRes = await fetch('/api/auth/session')
    const sessionData = await sessionRes.json()
    
    if (sessionData && sessionData.user) {
      // Session established, safe to redirect
      router.push(callbackUrl)
      return
    }
    
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500))
  }
}
```

## Result
- ✅ Session cookie is properly set before redirect
- ✅ Middleware can detect authenticated users correctly
- ✅ No more secondary login modal for authenticated admin/core users
- ✅ Smooth authentication flow with proper session handling

## Testing
1. Sign in with Twitter (sharafi_eth)
2. Navigate to protected routes (/admin, /api/projects/all)
3. Verify no login modal appears
4. Verify middleware logs show `Token exists: true`
