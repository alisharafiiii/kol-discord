# Sentiment Evolution Chart Fix

## Issue
The Sentiment Evolution chart in Discord analytics was not showing 100% on certain days (June 24 and June 26, 2025). Investigation revealed the chart was using placeholder random data instead of actual sentiment values.

## Root Cause
1. Frontend components were generating random data with TODO comments
2. Backend wasn't providing sentiment breakdown percentages per day in the `dailyTrend` array

## Solution Applied

### Backend Changes (lib/services/discord-service.ts)
- Modified `dailyData` structure to include `sentimentBreakdown` tracking
- Added sentiment counting per day for positive, neutral, and negative
- Updated `dailyTrend` output to include percentage calculations

### Frontend Changes  
- Updated `app/discord/share/[id]/page.tsx` to use real data
- Updated `app/admin/discord/[id]/page.tsx` to use real data
- Removed placeholder random data generation

### Type Updates
- Updated `lib/types/discord.ts` to include `sentimentBreakdown` in dailyTrend items
- Updated frontend interfaces to match

## Result
The Sentiment Evolution chart now displays accurate sentiment percentages that always add up to 100% for each day.

## Verification
Run analytics validation scripts to confirm:
```bash
node scripts/quick-analytics-check.mjs
node scripts/validate-analytics-frontend.mjs
```
