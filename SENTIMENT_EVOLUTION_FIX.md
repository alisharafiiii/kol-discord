# Sentiment Evolution Chart Fix

## Issue
The Sentiment Evolution chart in Discord analytics was not showing 100% on certain days (June 24 and June 26, 2025). Investigation revealed the chart was using placeholder random data instead of actual sentiment values.

## Root Cause
1. Frontend components were generating random data with TODO comments
2. Backend wasn't providing sentiment breakdown percentages per day in the `dailyTrend` array

## Solution Applied

### Backend Changes (lib/services/discord-service.ts)
- Modified `dailyData` structure to include `sentimentBreakdown` tracking
- Added sentiment counting per day for positive, neutral, and negative
- Updated `dailyTrend` output to include percentage calculations

### Frontend Changes  
- Updated `app/discord/share/[id]/page.tsx` to use real data
- Updated `app/admin/discord/[id]/page.tsx` to use real data
- Removed placeholder random data generation

### Type Updates
- Updated `lib/types/discord.ts` to include `sentimentBreakdown` in dailyTrend items
- Updated frontend interfaces to match

## Important: Caching Issues

The Discord Analytics API has a **30-second in-memory cache**. After deploying changes:

1. **Restart the Next.js development server** to load the new code
2. **Wait 30 seconds** for the cache to expire, or
3. **Add `?forceRefresh=true`** to the URL to bypass the cache

## Result
The Sentiment Evolution chart now displays accurate sentiment percentages that always add up to 100% for each day.

## Verification
Run analytics validation scripts to confirm:
```bash
node scripts/quick-analytics-check.mjs
node scripts/validate-analytics-frontend.mjs
```

## Troubleshooting
If values still appear random or changing:
1. Check if multiple Next.js servers are running (`ps aux | grep next`)
2. Ensure all servers are restarted
3. Clear browser cache
4. Use `?forceRefresh=true` query parameter
