# Stable Code Registry

This document tracks all code sections that have been marked as STABLE & VERIFIED and should not be modified without explicit review.

## Purpose
To maintain stability in critical parts of the codebase by clearly marking sections that:
- Have been thoroughly tested and verified
- Handle critical functionality
- Have complex logic that was carefully debugged
- Are essential for proper system operation

## Registry Format
Each entry includes:
- **File Path**: Location of the stable code
- **Date Verified**: When the code was last verified
- **Description**: What the code does
- **Critical Features**: Key functionality that must be preserved

2. **Impact Analysis**: Assess how changes might affect the critical features
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure all critical features still work after modifications
4. **Update Documentation**: Update both the inline comment and this registry
5. **Peer Review**: Have changes reviewed by another developer familiar with the system

## Modification Guidelines

1. **Before Making Changes**:
   - Review this registry
   - Understand the current functionality
   - Plan changes carefully
   - Test in development environment

2. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Test authentication flow end-to-end
   - Verify JWT token generation and session handling
   - Test tweet sync with various campaign formats
