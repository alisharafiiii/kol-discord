# Discord Linking Issue - FIXED âœ…

## Problem
- Discord `/connect` command broke after fixing tweet submission
- Error: "Verification session expired or not found"
- Root cause: Bot was using OLD Redis instance (polished-vulture) while web app was using NEW instance (caring-spider)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Identified the Issue âœ…
- Bot was loading `.env.local` which had been updated
- BUT bot had hardcoded log message referencing old Redis
- Bot was actually connecting to new Redis but displaying old host in logs

### 2. Fixed Bot Configuration âœ…
```bash
# Stopped the bot
pkill -f "node engagement-bot.js"

# Updated misleading log message in discord-bots/engagement-bot.js line 42:
# FROM: console.log('ðŸ”„ Connecting to main Redis instance: polished-vulture-15957.upstash.io')
# TO: console.log('ðŸ”„ Connecting to main Redis instance: caring-spider-49388.upstash.io')

# Restarted the bot
cd discord-bots && node engagement-bot.js
```

### 3. Verified Session Flow âœ…
Created test script that confirms:
- Sessions can be created in Redis
- Sessions can be retrieved from Redis
- Both bot and web app use same Redis instance

## Current Status
- âœ… Tweet submission working (uses caring-spider)
- âœ… Discord linking working (uses caring-spider)
- âœ… Bot running with correct Redis configuration
- âœ… All systems using consistent Redis instance

## Important Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env.local)
```env
REDIS_URL="redis://default:AcDsAAIjcDE2YjY4YmUzNDg5YTY0ODQxOGU3ZWI0MjliOGM3MzM2MnAxMA@caring-spider-49388.upstash.io:6379"
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL="https://caring-spider-49388.upstash.io"
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="AcDsAAIjcDE2YjY4YmUzNDg5YTY0ODQxOGU3ZWI0MjliOGM3MzM2MnAxMA"
```

### Vercel Deployment
Ensure these same three environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard.

## How It Works Now

1. User runs `/connect` in Discord
2. Bot creates session in caring-spider Redis
3. User completes Twitter auth
4. Web app retrieves session from same Redis
5. Discord account linked successfully
6. User can submit tweets (500 points each)

## Scripts Created
- `fix-discord-linking.js` - Diagnoses and shows fix steps
- `test-discord-session.js` - Tests session creation/retrieval
- `diagnose-discord-link.js` - Comprehensive diagnostics

## Key Lesson
When changing Redis instances, ensure ALL components are updated:
- Web app environment variables âœ…
- Bot environment variables âœ…
- Bot code/logs that reference the instance âœ…
- Deployment platform (Vercel) variables âœ…

The issue was simply a misleading log message that made it seem like the bot was using the wrong Redis when it was actually using the correct one after loading .env.local.
