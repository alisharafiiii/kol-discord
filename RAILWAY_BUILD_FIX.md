# Railway Build Fix & Discord Link Deployment

## Issue
- Railway build was failing with error: `pnpm i --frozen-lockfile` exit code 1
- Discord link endpoint was returning 404 on production
- Project had conflicting package managers (npm and pnpm)

## Root Cause
The project had both `package-lock.json` (npm) and `pnpm-lock.yaml` (pnpm) files. Railway detected the pnpm lockfile and tried to use pnpm, but the lockfiles were out of sync, causing the build to fail.

## Solution
1. Removed `pnpm-lock.yaml` to standardize on npm
2. Ran `npm install` to ensure package-lock.json is up to date
3. Committed and pushed changes

## Changes Made
1. **Discord Link Endpoint**: Added detailed logging to help debug issues
2. **Package Manager**: Standardized on npm by removing pnpm-lock.yaml
3. **Deployment**: Both changes pushed to trigger new deployments

## Next Steps
1. Railway should now build successfully using npm
2. Once deployed, the Discord link endpoint will be available
3. The `/connect` command in Discord should work properly

## Verification
- Check Railway dashboard for successful build
- Discord link endpoint should return 401 (not 404) when accessed without auth
- Users should be able to link their Discord and Twitter accounts

## Important Notes
- Always use `npm install` (not pnpm) for this project
- The Discord link endpoint requires authentication to work
- Sessions are stored in Redis with 5-minute TTL
