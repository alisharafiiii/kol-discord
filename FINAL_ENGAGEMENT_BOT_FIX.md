# Final Fix: Engagement Bot Submit Command

## ✅ Issue Fixed

The `/submit` command was stuck on "thinking" due to an incompatible Redis `zadd` command format.

### What Was Changed:

1. **Replaced Sorted Set with List**
   - Changed from `redis.zadd()` (sorted set) to `redis.lpush()` (list)
   - This avoids the Upstash Redis zadd syntax issues
   - Keeps last 100 tweets using `ltrim`

2. **Updated Batch Processor**
   - Changed to read from list instead of sorted set
   - Still filters by 24-hour window

3. **Added Error Handling**
   - Wrapped submit logic in try-catch
   - Better error messages for users

## 🎯 Test Now:

The bot has been restarted. Try these commands:

1. **`/submit`** - Enter a tweet URL like:
   ```
   https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890
   ```

2. **`/stats`** - Should show your current stats without buffering

3. **`/connect`** - If you haven't connected yet

## 📝 Important Notes:

- You must be an approved user in the KOL system
- You can only submit your own tweets (unless admin)
- Daily limits apply based on tier:
  - Tier 1: 3 tweets/day
  - Tier 2: 5 tweets/day
  - Tier 3: 10 tweets/day

The bot is now running smoothly without the zadd errors!
