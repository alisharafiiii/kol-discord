# EDT Implementation Summary

## Overview
All date/time calculations and displays have been switched from UTC to EDT (Eastern Daylight Time, UTC-4).

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Timezone Utilities
- Created `lib/utils/timezone.ts` for TypeScript projects
- Created `discord-bots/lib/timezone.js` for JavaScript bots
- Functions include:
  - `utcToEdt()` - Convert UTC to EDT
  - `edtToUtc()` - Convert EDT to UTC
  - `getCurrentEdt()` - Get current time in EDT
  - `getEdtMidnight()` - Get EDT midnight for any date
  - `toEdtIsoString()` - Format date as EDT ISO string
  - `getEdtDateString()` - Get YYYY-MM-DD format in EDT
  - `getEdtHour()` - Get EDT hour (0-23)

### 2. Discord Analytics (`lib/services/discord-service.ts`)
- All timestamps now use `toEdtIsoString()`
- Hourly activity groups by EDT hours using `getEdtHour()`
- Daily data groups by EDT dates using `getEdtDateString()`
- Date ranges calculated using `getEdtMidnight()`

### 3. Discord Analytics UI (`app/admin/discord/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Date picker uses EDT midnight calculations
- Labels updated to show "EDT" timezone
- Default date ranges use EDT

### 4. Engagement Bot (`discord-bots/engagement-bot.js`)
- All timestamps use `toEdtIsoString()`
- Daily submission limits reset at EDT midnight
- Daily keys use EDT date format: `engagement:daily:userId:YYYY-MM-DD`

### 5. Engagement Batch Processor (`discord-bots/engagement-batch-processor.js`)
- Timestamps use EDT format
- Daily processing aligns with EDT dates

### 6. Points Service (`lib/services/points-service.ts`)
- Point award timestamps use EDT
- Daily leaderboard keys use EDT dates
- History timestamps in EDT format

## Key Behavioral Changes

### Daily Resets
- **Before**: Daily limits and leaderboards reset at 00:00 UTC
- **After**: Daily limits and leaderboards reset at 00:00 EDT (20:00 UTC)

### Date Grouping
- **Before**: Messages on June 24 at 11 PM EDT counted as June 25 UTC
- **After**: Messages on June 24 at 11 PM EDT count as June 24 EDT

### Hourly Analytics
- **Before**: Hourly activity grouped by UTC hours
- **After**: Hourly activity grouped by EDT hours

### Redis Keys
- Daily keys now use EDT date format (YYYY-MM-DD based on EDT)
- Examples:
  - `engagement:daily:user123:2024-06-24` (EDT date)
  - `points:leaderboard:2024-06-24` (EDT date)
  - `discord:messages:daily:2024-06-24` (EDT date)

## UI Updates
- All date/time displays show "EDT" label
- Discord analytics page explicitly states EDT timezone
- Date pickers default to EDT midnight boundaries

## Important Notes

### 1. Fixed EDT Offset
- Implementation uses a fixed -4 hour offset for EDT
- Does NOT automatically switch to EST (-5 hours) in winter
- Consider implementing dynamic EST/EDT switching for full year coverage

### 2. Existing Data
- Existing timestamps in the database are not modified
- Only display and new data creation uses EDT
- Historical data interpretation may need consideration

### 3. No Side Effects On
- User profiles and core data structures
- Authentication system
- Contest submissions (stored timestamps unchanged)
- Campaign system
- Existing Redis data structures

## Testing
Run `node scripts/verify-edt-no-side-effects.js` to verify system integrity.

## Migration Considerations
If switching back to UTC or implementing EST/EDT switching:
1. Update timezone utilities to handle daylight saving time
2. Consider data migration for date-based Redis keys
3. Update all UI labels accordingly
4. Test thoroughly with dates around DST transitions
