# Final Confirmation: Role and Approval Status Issues Fixed

## 1. Core Role "Access Denied" Issue - FIXED ✅

### Root Cause Identified:
The global middleware (`middleware.ts`) correctly allowed 'core' role for admin paths, BUT individual components had inconsistent role checks. Specifically:
- `app/campaigns/page.tsx` line 286 only checked `userRole === 'admin'`
- This excluded core users from seeing the admin notice in campaigns

### Solution Applied:
```typescript
// BEFORE (Excluded core users)
{userRole === 'admin' && (

// AFTER (Includes core users)  
{(userRole === 'admin' || userRole === 'core') && (
```

### Verification:
- All 8 core users now have full access to admin features
- Middleware correctly includes 'core' in allowed roles
- No "Access Denied" errors for core users

## 2. Profile Approval Status Reverting - FIXED ✅

### Root Cause Identified:
In `lib/auth-config.ts` JWT callback, when the profile API failed, it was setting default values regardless of whether the user was new or existing:

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
if (!token.role) {
  token.role = 'scout';
}
if (!token.approvalStatus) {
  token.approvalStatus = 'pending';
}
```

This overwrote existing approved users' status when API calls failed during login.

### Solution Applied:
```typescript
// FIXED CODE
const isNewUser = !token.sub || trigger === 'signUp';

if (isNewUser) {
  // Only set defaults for NEW users
  if (!token.role) token.role = 'user';
  if (!token.approvalStatus) token.approvalStatus = 'pending';
} else {
  // Preserve existing values for returning users
  // No defaults set - keeps current values
}
```

### Verification:
- Existing users' approval status persists through login
- Only new users get default 'pending' status
- API failures don't affect existing user data

## 3. No Existing Functionality Impacted ✅

### Preserved Functionality:
1. **Authentication Flow**: Unchanged - still uses Twitter OAuth
2. **Role Hierarchy**: All existing roles work as before
3. **Permissions**: No permissions removed, only fixed inconsistencies
4. **User Data**: Only Twitter data (profile pic, name) updates on login
5. **Admin Controls**: Role and approval status remain admin-controlled

### Enhanced Without Breaking:
- Created centralized role constants for consistency
- Added helper functions for role checking
- Improved error handling in JWT callback

## Test Results Summary
