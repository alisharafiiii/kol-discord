# Users Tab Implementation

## Overview
Created a dedicated "Users" tab in the admin panel to manage and view all opted-in engagement bot users. This separates user management from settings, providing a cleaner and more intuitive interface.

## Features Implemented

### 1. New Dedicated Users Tab
- **Location**: Admin > Engagement > Users tab
- **Purpose**: Centralized view of all opted-in engagement bot users
- **Access**: Admin, Core, and Viewer roles

### 2. User Information Display
Each user entry shows:
- **Twitter handle** with profile picture
- **Discord username** and **Discord ID** (in monospace font for easy copying)
- **Discord servers** they're opted-in through
- **Tier** (MICRO, RISING, STAR, LEGEND, HERO)
- **Total points** (editable by admins)
- **Tweets submitted** count
- **Engagement metrics**: Likes, Retweets, Comments

### 3. Key Features
- **Automatic sorting**: Users sorted by total points (highest to lowest)
- **User count indicator**: Shows total number of opted-in users
- **Refresh button**: Manually refresh user data
- **Inline point editing**: Click on points to edit (same as before)
- **Responsive design**: Table scrolls horizontally on small screens

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy loading**: User data only fetched when Users tab is clicked
- **Duplicate prevention**: API ensures no duplicate users by Twitter handle
- **Efficient data fetching**: Uses optimized queries for engagement stats

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **`app/admin/engagement/page.tsx`**:
   - Added 'users' to the tab type definition
   - Created dedicated Users tab content section
   - Moved opted-in users table from Settings to Users tab
   - Added Discord ID column to the table
   - Added refresh button and user count
   - Removed duplicate user section from Settings tab

2. **`app/api/engagement/opted-in-users/route.ts`**:
   - Already had complete implementation
   - Returns sorted data by total points
   - Includes all necessary user information

### Data Structure
Users are displayed with the following information:
```typescript
{
  discordId: string        // Discord user ID
  twitterHandle: string    // Twitter username
  discordUsername: string  // Discord display name
  discordServers: string[] // List of servers user is in
  tier: string            // User tier (micro, rising, etc.)
  totalPoints: number     // Total accumulated points
  profilePicture: string  // Profile image URL
  tweetsSubmitted: number // Count of submitted tweets
  totalLikes: number      // Total likes received
  totalRetweets: number   // Total retweets received
  totalComments: number   // Total comments received
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear separation of concerns**: Settings tab now only contains tier configurations and transactions
2. **Better organization**: All user-related data in one place
3. **Improved visibility**: Discord ID now clearly displayed for admin reference
4. **Quick actions**: Refresh button for immediate updates
5. **Visual feedback**: User count shows scale at a glance

## Usage

### Viewing Users
1. Navigate to Admin > Engagement
2. Click on the "Users" tab
3. View all opted-in users sorted by points

### Editing Points
1. Click on any user's point value
2. Enter new value
3. Click "Save" to apply or "Cancel" to discard

### Refreshing Data
- Click the "Refresh" button in the top-right of the Users section
- Data will be refetched and re-sorted

## Notes

- The Settings tab now focuses exclusively on tier configurations and point transactions
- User data is fetched on-demand to optimize initial page load
- All existing functionality (point editing, etc.) remains intact
- The system handles duplicate prevention automatically
