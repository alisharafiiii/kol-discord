## 🔧 If Commands Don't Appear

1. **Close Discord completely** and reopen
2. **Type `/` and wait** 2-3 seconds
3. **Look for nabulines_bot** in the dropdown

## ⚠️ Channel Setup Required

The bot is trying to post to `#engagement-tracker` but doesn't have permission. 

**To fix:**
1. Create a channel named `engagement-tracker`
2. Give the bot "Send Messages" permission in that channel
3. Tweets will then be posted there automatically

## 🚀 Quick Test

Try these commands now:
```
/tweets     - Should show recent tweets
/stats      - Should show your stats
/submit     - Submit a tweet (creates in #engagement-tracker)
```

## 🛠️ Useful Commands

```bash
# Check if bot is running
ps aux | grep engagement-bot

# View bot logs
cd discord-bots
tail -f bot-debug.log

# Restart bot if needed
cd discord-bots
pkill -f "node engagement-bot.js"
node engagement-bot.js
```

The bot is working! Discord may take a few minutes to show the commands.
